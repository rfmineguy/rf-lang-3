# RFLang
> **Notice**
> This language is in active development and shouldnt be used quite yet.

RFLang is a programming language that has been in development for a number of months now. I've been interested in language development for a while now, and have been combining what I learn in school with what I learn through trial and error doing the wrong thing. As you can see from the repo name this is the third attempt at writing this language.

# Grammar
I didn't realize how much the grammar would evolve over the development of the language, which is really interesting.
If you want to look at the grammar, take a look at the `grammar.g` file. (Note: this is just a scratch text file that I used to experiment with various reduction rules.

> **Fun Fact**
> There is no parser generator used in this language
